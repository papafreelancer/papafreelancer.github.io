## Hi there. This is my personal repository on GitHub for keeping the projects based on the techonolgies I already know how to use:

+ HTML5/CSS3
+ CSS3 Animations
+ Flexbox CSS/Grid CSS
+ Bootstrap 4
+ Vanilla JS, JQuery
+ CMS: Textolite, Wordpress
+ Responsive web design, crossbrowser, availability

### Some of them are still in the process of learning, so all the websites will be updated soon. 
+ [The Great Keksby](https://papafreelancer.github.io/keks/ "The Great Keksby") - Landing page using Flexbox CSS.
+ [Nerd](https://papafreelancer.github.io/nerds/ "Nerds") -  Landing page using Flexbox CSS.
